# CSGO TIMER

CSGO TIMER is a project/program created to give a csgo player info about the bomb state.
With CSGO TIMER you can get info like how many time is left to the bomb until it explode, so you can judge if you should or not try to defuse it, try to win the round, you simply walk away.

# Disclaimer

You will not get vaced using this, because it uses Valve's public gamestate integration. The program is simply using the information from the CFG file and transforming it into sounds and external visuals that cannot be visually overlayed on top of the fullscreen game.
It is a tool made available by VALVE.

# How it works ?

Explained in VALVEÂ´S words:

"The game client by default can expose all game state, and send an update notification as soon as the client game state changes, to any local or remote HTTP POST endpoint using JSON as the game state structure. It just needs to know where the player wants to submit game state and what notifications to relay. This document will help third parties develop their tools and processes integrating with CS: GO game state.
